This project develops a dynamic, automated program designed to facilitate the collection and analysis of media from various social platforms, such as Telegram and TikTok. It integrates cutting-edge technologies and programming languages to detect and categorize individuals based on facial recognition.

### Technologies Used:

#### Primary language - Python

#### Face Recognition Libraries - DeepFace , OpenCV
We employ the DeepFace library for deep learning-based face recognition, enhancing our application's ability to perform complex facial recognition tasks efficiently.

#### Amazon AWS Services
Our system utilizes several AWS services to boost its performance:
- **S3** 
- **DynamoDB**: (Optionally)
- **AWS Facial Recognition Services**
- **Implimented with boto3 API**

#### Social media's platforms ApI - Telethon
