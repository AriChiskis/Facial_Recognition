# Facial Recognition Project

## Introduction
The Facial Recognition Project is an advanced automated system designed to address urgent public safety concerns by identifying individuals in media sourced from various social platforms such as Telegram and TikTok. Leveraging the power of technologies like DeepFace and Amazon AWS recognition services, the system categorizes recognized individuals and updates records with new data.

### Current Issues
Due to ongoing issues with the Telethon API, functionality for media downloads from Telegram is temporarily disabled.
