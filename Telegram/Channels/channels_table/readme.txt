you have the channels_links.txt file it containt the links of the telegram channels
create_datafrmae_of_channels.py will create you a datafrmae with the columns name and link
that will contain the name of the channel and its link.



for example:
 if the link is: https://t.me/cat
 then :
    name = cat
    link  = https://t.me/cat

goodluck :)
